Installing and uninstalling
Now that the Windows Service is operational it can be installed. Topshelf provides functionality for this so installutil.exe is no longer needed. The Windows Service can be installed from the command prompt so start a Command Prompt with the Run as administrator option and navigate to the binary output folder of the project. Run the executable of the Console Application with install as command line argument.
